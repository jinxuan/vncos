We want to develop a native client or network-client like operating system that supports resource virtualization. It is based on mini-os in Xen, and has minimal front-end drivers, as well as minimal libraries in order to support a light-weight web browser. It's designed to utilize computing resources from cloud, including both hardware resources and application resources, based on a distributed hypervisor. At the mean while, it will employ trusted computing techs to guarantee the authentication and authorization of the end users.
